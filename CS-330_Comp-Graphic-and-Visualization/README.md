- How do I approach designing software?

I first start by seeing what I have. Then what I have to do. I make a mental plan often creating functions and leaving comments for them to do a certain thing. I list it all out before coding any of them. This helps me stay organized and see my progress in real time. 

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I think I may be better at designing minor details and changes. I enjoyed being able to change one thing, and run the code to see what changed. I learned mostly by doing that. 

- What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed a structured design process that included planning, implementation, testing, and iteration.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics used in this design approach can be applied to future projects by maintaining a structured and methodical workflow. Breaking down large tasks into smaller components, implementing them incrementally, and conducting regular testing can help manage complexity and ensure quality. 

- How do I approach developing programs?

I like to use comments to list out teh tasks and then go through and fill out one task at a time. This works better in Data science. 

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Probably the run the code - make a change - run the code again - make a change method. It seems to work best on front end but not on backend devlopment.

- How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a crucial role in the development process. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks and iterating over each one, I was able to focus on incremental improvements and quickly identify and fix issues. 

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code evolved significantly. Initially, I focused on getting the basic functionality working. As I progressed, I emphasized more on code optimization, modularity, and reusability. I learned to plan more effectively, anticipate potential issues, and address them proactively.

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The fundamentals all have a way of carrying over. If anything, I gain teh ability to adapt new skills and look at things in a different perspective.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I am not sure they do outside of multidiemnsional modeling to display data. I am more a data scientist.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
