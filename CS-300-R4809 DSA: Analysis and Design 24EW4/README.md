# CS 300 

- Will contain Project 1 and Project 2

Prompt
For this course, you will be submitting one portion of each project into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. From Project One, submit your analysis of the run-time and memory for the data structures. From Project Two, submit the working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. Together, these documents showcase your work in data structures and algorithms.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will also help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

- **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
My biggest problem was getting C++ to work on my computer. After that, HashTables were the hardest for me to learn. When I got to Binary Search Tree's, things finally clicked and it allmade much more sense. I still have much to learn though and may impliment them all in Python before long. 

- **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I spent over 8 hours on the Hashtables assignments. I watched videos, searched old examples online, and used the class resources. I even asked the professor. After leaving it alone for 2 days, I came back to it and was able to fix my issues. 

- **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
At some point, I started looking up how to make the data structures work in python. It really helped with the logic behind it all. After that, You just have to add in pointers and differeing syntax. Easy Peasy. Mostly?

- **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
Well my trade, I do not design software or devlop programs. I am a Data guy. That being said, I is all good to know and may give me new tools for solving problems in the future. It definaetly helps my confidence. 

- **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I would say I can make more modular projects. I still have to work on my comments in the code though.
