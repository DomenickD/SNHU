I started with figure out what needs to happen as far as tables to support the pages. Then I built out the file structure and then slowly filled them in logically as the user would see it, so login screen was first. 

- **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

Testing was done using an emulator to simulate user interactions. This process is important to identify bugs and usability issues early. It revealed minor issues with input validation and navigation, which were fixed promptly.

- **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

One challenge was ensuring seamless navigation and data consistency between screens. Innovation was required in managing state and data passing between fragments, which was resolved by implementing a central database helper class.

- **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

The login and registration system was particularly successful, showcasing skills in database operations, user authentication, and secure data handling, ensuring users could register, log in, and access their data efficiently and securely.
