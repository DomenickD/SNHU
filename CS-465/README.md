## Full Stack Development Project - README

### Architecture

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**
- *Express HTML*: Server-rendered pages; good for static content but slower as it requires full page reloads.
- *JavaScript*: Enhances interactivity; allows dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
- *Single-Page Application (SPA)*: Loads a single HTML page; provides a fast, smooth user experience with dynamic content updates.

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**
- *MongoDB* offers flexibility with unstructured data, horizontal scalability, and rapid iteration, making it ideal for handling varied data types and large volumes of data.

### Functionality

**How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**
- *JSON* is a data format used for data interchange between frontend and backend; itâ€™s language-independent, unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language. JSON acts as the communication bridge, transmitting data between the client and server.

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**
- Refactored code by creating reusable UI components, such as trip cards, which reduced redundancy, improved maintainability, and enabled consistent display across different views.

### Testing

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**
- API testing involved testing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints using tools like Postman. The security layer with JWT added complexity, requiring tests for valid and invalid tokens to ensure proper access control.

### Reflection

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
- The course enhanced my skills in full stack development, including RESTful API design, state management in SPAs, and applying security best practices. These skills align with industry standards and improve my marketability in the tech industry.
