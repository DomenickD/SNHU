For this course, submit the completed software design document that you created for your client, The Gaming Room, into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. This completed design document demonstrates your ability to be effective in working through the design of a software application and to communicate it effectively to a client and your development team members.

Once you have submitted your software design document, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

- **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room client is a company that currently has a game application called "Draw It or Lose It," originally created for Android systems. 
The client wanted to expand their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment. 
Specifically, they requested a web-based application that could scale up to thousands of players and support both iOS and Android mobile platforms, as well as traditional desktop-based operating systems. 
The application needed to have a modern, responsive HTML interface running inside web browsers for desktop clients, as well as on mobile platforms.

- **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I think the executive summary was where I shined the most. As we got more into the weeds of the design, I kept feeling that there are more than one way to solve this and so it felt less defined and sure if this was the best way without collaborating with a team. 

- **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Working through a design document helped me organize my thoughts and address each aspect of the software development process.
  
- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could revise one part of my work on these documents, I would choose to expand on the System Architecture View section. It was not needed for this but it may have provided alot of much needed detail. 
  
- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user's needs by carefully analyzing the client's requirements and incorporating them into the software design. For example, I considered the need for a scalable, cross-platform application that supports multiple teams and unique game and team names.
  
- **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

When approaching software design, I used techniques such as modular design, use of design patterns (e.g., singleton pattern), and evaluation of different technology stacks for server and client-side development. I think as I grow in software, I may even consider more!
