**Program Overview**

This C++ program is designed to manage and report on item frequencies from sales data for the Corner Grocer store. It offers a menu-driven interface allowing users to:

1. Search for the frequency of a specific item.
2. Display the frequency of all items.
3. Display a histogram representing item frequencies.
4. Exit the program.

Data is loaded from `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt`, processed, and stored in a map for efficient lookups. 
A backup of the processed data is saved to `frequency.dat`.

**Setup and Compilation**

*Prerequisites*: C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, Visual C++).

**File Structure**

`main.cpp`: Contains the main logic, menu system, and interfaces for user interaction.

`CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt`: Input file containing item names and their frequencies.

`frequency.dat`: Backup file generated by the program to store processed item frequencies.

**Key Functions**


`main`

*Description*: Initializes the program, loads data, and handles the main menu loop.
Inputs: None.
Outputs: None.


`displayMenu`

*Description*: Displays the main menu options to the user.

Inputs: None.

Outputs: Prints menu options to the console.


`processChoice`

*Description*: Processes the user's menu selection.

Parameters: choice (int), itemFrequencies (map<string, int>&).

Functionality: Calls specific functions based on user choice.

`loadDataFromFile`

*Description*: Loads item frequencies from a file and stores them in a map.

Parameters: itemFrequencies (map<string, int>&).

Functionality: Reads CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt, normalizes item names to lowercase, and populates itemFrequencies.


`displayItemFrequency`

*Description*: Displays the frequency of a specific item.

Parameters: itemFrequencies (const map<string, int>&), item (const string&).

Functionality: Searches for an item in itemFrequencies and displays its frequency.


`displayAllFrequencies`

*Description*: Displays frequencies of all items.

Parameters: itemFrequencies (const map<string, int>&).

Functionality: Iterates through itemFrequencies and prints each item's frequency.


`displayHistogram`

*Description*: Displays a histogram of item frequencies.

Parameters: itemFrequencies (const map<string, int>&).

Functionality: For each item, prints a line of asterisks corresponding to its frequency.


`writeBackupData`

*Description*: Writes item frequencies to a backup file.

Parameters: itemFrequencies (const map<string, int>&).

Functionality: Saves itemFrequencies to frequency.dat.
