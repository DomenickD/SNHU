# Module Eight Journal


- **How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Functions and well defined variables that are named after what they do. The advantage to working this way with the module in python is once the py file is working, you can narrow down errors and locate/fix them fasters. 

- **How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

First, you break down teh problem into parts and list out what each part needs. Then make a plan or structure for each part and fill in the parts one by one, testing before and after each part/step. My approach here was probably cleaner and involved a side step of learning what dash was to build teh dashboard. Once the dash board was working, I worked on teh filters. That took me a while to make it function correctly.

- **What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing and implementing efficient algorithms and software solutions. Their work is essential in advancing technology and improving various aspects of daily life and business operations. We helped Grazisos Salvare improve efficency, scalability, and helped them make data driven decisions (by breed of dog to use in a situation).
