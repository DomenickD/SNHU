# CS 370 Current Emerging Trends in Computer Science

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

- The code I was given by my school were all the python files. Some of the structure was given in ipynb but the code was 4 years old and had to be nearly completely reworked in every project. 

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

- Computer scientists are the masterminds behind the digital world, designing and building the software and hardware that power our modern lives. Their work is essential, shaping everything from communication to healthcare, and driving innovation that improves our world.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

- Computer scientists break down complex problems into manageable parts, focus on the core elements, and design step-by-step solutions. They then implement these solutions in code, test them, and refine them for optimal performance. (Never forget the free lunch theorem - try everything possible. You never know what the best model will be for the data!)

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

- You have a duty to protect user privacy and data, build secure systems, be transparent about your technology, and ensure it's fair and accessible to all. Ultimately, take responsibility for your work's impact and address any negative consequences.
